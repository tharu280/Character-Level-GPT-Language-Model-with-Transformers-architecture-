# Character-Level-GPT-Language-Model-with-Transformers-architecture-
A character-level language model built using PyTorch, inspired by the architecture of GPT. It starts with hyperparameter definitions and imports necessary libraries. The data is loaded and preprocessed from a text file, creating mappings between characters and their integer representations for encoding and decoding text. The code includes helper functions to generate batches of training data and estimate loss. The core model, GPTLanguageModel, comprises essential components such as self-attention heads, multi-head attention, feed-forward layers, and transformer blocks, each implementing critical parts of the Transformer architecture. This modular setup facilitates learning complex dependencies within sequences, enabling the model to predict the next character effectively. The code also outlines the training procedure using the AdamW optimizer and sets the foundation for further fine-tuning and evaluation.
